# NanoporeDataAugmenter

Contains method for augmenting Nanopore read data. The customTFOps has a routine to compute Brownian Motion Data Augmentation on tensorflow. The CuPy implementation can augment using noise addition, linear stretching, magnitude multiplication and Brownian Motion data augmentation together, in an optimized function.
